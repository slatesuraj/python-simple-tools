## Tools
1. File Manager
   A file management CLI can help users perform various file-related operations, such as creating, deleting, moving, and listing files and directories. Let's create a simple file management CLI using Python and the argparse library, which is included in Python's standard library.
   
   You can use the following commands with the CLI:
   To create a new file: python file_manager.py create_file --file <file_name>
   To delete a file: python file_manager.py delete_file --file <file_name>
   To create a new directory: python file_manager.py create_directory --dir <directory_name>
   To delete a directory: python file_manager.py delete_directory --dir <directory_name>
   To list files in the current directory or a specified directory: python file_manager.py list_files --dir <directory_name>

   This file management CLI provides basic functionalities to manage files and directories, and you can expand it further based on your specific needs. It demonstrates the power of building useful and practical command-line interfaces with Python, making it a valuable tool for automating file-related tasks.

3. Task Manager
   This CLI will allow users to add tasks, view the task list, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
   
   You can use the following commands with the CLI:
   To add a new task: python task_manager.py add --task "Write a report"
   To view the list of tasks: python task_manager.py view
   To mark a task as completed (replace <task_index> with the index of the task from the list): python task_manager.py complete --index <task_index>
   To delete a task (replace <task_index> with the index of the task from the list): python task_manager.py delete --index <task_index>

   This task management CLI allows users to manage their tasks easily from the command line. It provides a simple yet effective interface for organizing and tracking tasks without the need for a full-fledged task management application.
